# Final Project

Time to make a real project with elm!

## Potential Ideas

### Request Heavy

+ A project from API week
+ Build a Pok√©dex (you could fetch the data from here https://pokeapi.co/)
+ Build a weather app

### Logic Heavy

+ Build a game! But think small (you've only got 2 days tops!)
+ A card game could be a good fit
+ Rock paper scissors
+ Make your todo list even fancier!
+ Make a calculator (can you give it different themes or modes?)

## Deploying

Try to deploy your project, deploy it early too!
